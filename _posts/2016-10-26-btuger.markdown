I’ve known Github for a few years, because I’m an adept of open source development, and I’ve followed a couple small projects, but I was still surprised learning it was used for more than software development, and that it played such a big role in science.
However, my opinion, is that this transparency of information can only be good for everyone.

Times are changing and the way information flows as well, and science can definitely take advantage of that. By allowing multiple users access to a project, it motivates progress. This has been shown to work with multiple projects, such as Galaxy Zoo or Fold-it.

However, this point of view is still not accepted by many, mainly because scientists are rewarded by the number of papers they write. Nonetheless, scientific data nowadays has such a volume that a small team of scientist cannot hope to analyse everything. By embracing the open source development, things can change.
By changing how science should be viewed and how it should be treated, our knowledge as a whole can move forward, which is why I agree with the partnership between Berkeley, University of Washington and NYU.
