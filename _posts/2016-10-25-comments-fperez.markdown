#### **Key Statements**

- *We've been given nearly $38M of VC funding and a 5 year runway, now it's our job to make it beyond this.*

- *The probability of failure is non-negligible, but these are the kinds of problems worth failing on.*

- *the incentive mechanisms of academic research are at sharp odds with the rising need for highly collaborative interdisciplinary research, where computation and data are first-class citizens.*

- *The creation of usable, robust computational tools, and the work of data acquisition and analysis must be treated as equal partners to methodological advances or domain-specific results.*

- 9 Problems of the Current Academic System:
  - hyper-specialization
  - collaboration across fields is punished
  - sharing is discouraged
  - interdisciplinarity  = *career suicide*
  - computation is not important
  - no rigor in coding / algorithmic usage
  - far from reality
  - no comprehensive strategy to teach computation & data skills
  - brain drain in favor of the industry (at the expense of academia)

#### ***Overarching*** **Questions**

- **Is the nature of science itself really changing?**

- **How do the institutions of science need to change in this context?**

  - resistance to change : only churches and armies are worse than academic institutions
  - hope to push for disruptive changes, locally & nationwide
  - make education, hiring, tenure and promotion a fair game
  - make lasting changes

#### ***Open Source*** **: A Key Ingredient**


- **Open Source vs. Commercial:**
    - Technically superior, built upon a better language.
    - Openly developed from the start: no more black boxes in science.
    - Based on validated, tested, documented, reusable code whose problems are publicly discussed and tracked.
    - Built collaboratively, with everyone participating as equal partners and worrying first about solving the problems.
    - Licensed as open source but in a way that would encourage industry participation and collaboration.


- **Fernando's take away from Open Source:**
  - learned a lot
  - built some hopefully interesting tools
  - made incredible friends
  - realized that *open source community practiced many of the ideals of science better than academia*
  - enjoyment of community events

#### **Combining Open Source with the Strengths of Academia**

- **Open Source:**
  - distributed
  - collaborative
  - mostly online
  - often volunteer


- **Academia:**
  - lasting presence
  - physical space where intense human, face-to-face collaboration can take place
  - deep expertise in many domains

<br>

#### **Outcome?**

- *Ask [Fernando] in five years [2018] how it went :)*
- let's have a look together at the latest newsletter

#### **The Berkeley Spirit**
- Free Speech Movement
- Anti-War Protests
- Afro-American Civic Rights
